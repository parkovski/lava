Symbolic model

There are a small number of intrinsic attributes that allow building up a full
symbolic model of a type system.

- Symbol / Attribute:
  A symbol is basically a container for a list of attributes. An attribute is
  an instance of another symbol. Therefore the types of attributes must
  themselves have instantiable attributes.

- Namespace
  The symbol contains names pointing to their own symbols.

- Provides
  Instances inherit attributes in this list.

- Requires
  Instances must provide attributes in this list.

- Instance
  Links to Namespace/Requires/Provides.

- Indexable
  Can look up values by index.

- IndexRef
  Refers to an index of a symbol.

- MemoryInfo
  Instance size and alignment.

- ArrayInfo
  An array of known size.

- TupleInfo
  A tuple or struct-like object.

- FunctionInfo
  Function - map from input to output.
